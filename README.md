# Expese App 

Application developed purely in Flutter.

# Description. 

Application developed using Flutter, a programming language with
a hybrid approach that allows you to develop both Android and IOS
application. 

This simple app allows the user to easily create and manage lists, 
which can be: 

- generic lists
- shipping lists
- lists of expenses made n a given period of time. 

# Structure

This application is structured on 4 different "pages"
including: 

- page that displays the information of the app
- page showing the Calendar and current day
- page that allows you to create lists by giving a name, 
day and much more. 
- page (home) that allows you to access, view and edit 
the lists created by ourselves. 

This app has been developed individually to approach the 
world oof Flutter, as if it were for fun, as it could be useful, 
it has been made avaible on my github profile: 
https://github.com/DiscoHub12

Seceral libreries were used which can be found in the 
pubsec.yaml file, especially taken from the 
flutter official site : https://flutter.dev/
